# Vanilla HTTP Server in Node.js

Code example from my blog on [Creating a Vanilla HTTP Server in Node.js](https://cainwatson.com/blog/creating-a-vanilla-http-server-in-node-js/).

Make sure to have node installed. Node 8 and up should work.

Run the `server.js` file in the repository directory to start it up.

```sh
$ node server.js
Server listening on port :8080 ðŸš€
```
